# Convergent React Native Core Concepts

This is a repo developed by officers of Texas Convergent that is filled with React code examples. It's designed to serve as a reference to new developers, who are unfamiliar with React Native, and get them familiar with the framework as quickly as possible.

## Running the project

While the repo is mainly used to show code references, you can also see the examples running in real time. To do so, you will need the following installed on your computer:

* Latest version of [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* A JS package manager
    * [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
    * [Yarn (My recommendation)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

Additionally, you will need the Expo Go app (https://expo.dev/) downloaded on your iOS or Android device.

Once you have both dependencies, clone this repo to your local machine. `cd` into the repository folder. If you've installed NPM, then run `npm install -g expo-cli`. If you've installed Yarn, run `yarn global add expo-cli`.

Afterwards run either `npm start` or `yarn start` or `expo start`, depending on your package manager, and a dashboard will appear on [localhost:19000](http://localhost:19000). 

Scan the QR code that appears either from the terminal that you ran the command from or from the dashboard the appears on the development server. It should open up the app in the Expo Go app on your device automatically.
